      <h1>Where Are They Located?</h1>
      <p>Black holes are astronomical objects that possess such strong gravitational forces that nothing, including light, can escape their grasp once it crosses a certain boundary called the event horizon. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity, resulting in a region of space with extremely high density.</p>
        <p>Black holes can be found throughout the universe, and their locations vary. They can exist as isolated objects or be part of binary systems where they orbit another star. Additionally, supermassive black holes reside at the centers of most galaxies, including our own Milky Way.</p>

  <p>To provide a sense of scale, I'll use the distance from the solar system (specifically, from Earth) to some well-known black holes:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*): Located at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, Sgr A* is a supermassive black hole with a mass of about 4 million times that of our Sun. It is approximately 26,000 light-years away from Earth.<br /></li>

    <li>Messier 87 (M87): This is another famous black hole that was imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019. M87 is a supermassive black hole located in the Virgo galaxy cluster. It has a mass of about 6.5 billion times that of our Sun and is situated approximately 55 million light-years away.<br /></li>

    <li>Cygnus X-1: This black hole is part of a binary system with a massive blue supergiant star. Cygnus X-1 is approximately 6,070 light-years away from Earth.<br /></li>
  </ol>

  <p>It's important to note that there are countless more black holes in various locations across the universe, and new discoveries are continually being made. The distances provided here are just a few examples to give you an idea of the range of distances between black holes and the solar system.</p>
