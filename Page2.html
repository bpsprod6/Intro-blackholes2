    <h1>How Does Black Holes Look Like?</h1>

    <p>
        Black holes are fascinating and mysterious objects in the universe. However, it's important to note that since black holes trap all light within their event horizon, we cannot directly observe them. So when we talk about how black holes "look," we're actually referring to the effects they have on their surroundings.

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Event Horizon:</strong> The event horizon is the boundary of a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. It appears as a dark, spherical region surrounding the black hole. The exact appearance depends on the black hole's mass, spin, and charge. Since light cannot escape, the event horizon appears black, absorbing all incoming radiation.<br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Accretion Disk:</strong> Many black holes are surrounded by an accretion diskâ€”a flat, swirling disk of hot, glowing matter. This disk forms when material, such as gas or dust, falls into the black hole due to its immense gravitational attraction. The matter in the disk heats up as it spirals inward, emitting intense radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. The appearance of the accretion disk can vary depending on the material and the black hole's properties. It often appears bright, with a distinctive glow.<br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gravitational Lensing:</strong> Black holes can also cause gravitational lensing, a phenomenon where their immense gravity bends and distorts the path of light passing nearby. This effect can create interesting visual distortions, such as warping and stretching of the background stars or other objects. It can even produce multiple images of the same object. The appearance of gravitational lensing near a black hole depends on its mass and the angle at which the observer is viewing it.<br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Jets and Outflows:</strong> Some black holes, particularly supermassive ones at the centers of galaxies, exhibit powerful jets of energetic particles. These jets are formed as matter from the accretion disk is channeled along magnetic field lines and ejected at high speeds into space. These jets can extend thousands of light-years and emit intense radiation, often in the form of radio waves. They appear as narrow, elongated structures emanating from the vicinity of the black hole.<br /><br />
